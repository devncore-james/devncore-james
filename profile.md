#### Developer Jaewung Lee
I have been engaged with C# since 2006 and with WPF since 2008, constantly evolving in these fields. As a first-generation WPF developer, I have a deep sense of responsibility and dedication to this domain. I am passionate and specialized in WPF and C#, and my ability to collaboratively work on and expand projects is one of my key technical strengths.

Through GitHub, I have showcased various open-source projects, some of which have garnered significant attention and support from developers. This experience motivates me greatly. I also offer packages through NuGet to make WPF more accessible.

Contributing to the community is one of my core values. I have consistently educated IT professionals and corporate practitioners about C#, WPF, and related frameworks, leading to my authoring a book on WPF. As a Microsoft MVP, I understand the importance of technical exchanges and information sharing, and as a member of the [DotNetDev](https://forum.dotnetdev.kr/u/jamesnet214/activity/topics) leadership, I am dedicated to community growth.

I value every moment and consider my colleagues precious. While I've faced various emotional challenges and setbacks, the continuous support and encouragement from seniors and peers have enabled me to persistently move forward.
